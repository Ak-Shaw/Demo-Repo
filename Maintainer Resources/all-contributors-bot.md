## Maintainer guidelines for all-contributors bot



Kindly go through the below resources for usage guidelines.

[Bot Usage](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage)

[Emoji Key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)



We have an [issue template](https://github.com/Crio-Bytes/Demo-Repo/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/acknowledge-contributions.md) for recognising contributions exclusively in place, in cases where we might've missed to acknowledge the efforts of our contributors. That said, the exclusive issue template approach should be implemented in [this](https://github.com/Crio-Bytes/Miscellaneous/issues/20) fashion to maintain proper workflow.

Kindly always refer to the [Emoji Key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) time after time for proper acknowledgement of the efforts of the contributors towards the organisation.
